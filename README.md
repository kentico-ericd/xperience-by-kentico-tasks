[![build](https://github.com/kentico-ericd/xperience-by-kentico-tasks/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kentico-ericd/xperience-by-kentico-tasks/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Description

This is a basic implementation of [Scheduled tasks](https://docs.kentico.com/13/configuring-xperience/scheduling-tasks) for Xperience by Kentico. This package does _not_ store information in the database or contain UI pages. This means that tasks are executed when the application starts (unless [time restricted](/docs/Usage-Guide.md)), then execute based on their provided intervals.
